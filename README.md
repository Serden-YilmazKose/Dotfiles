# Dotfiles

# THIS is a public repo to stash all of my dotfiles. Feel free to use them!
I used basic symlinks to link my dotfiles to the cloned repo.
This may not be the best way, but here is how I made my hardlinks:
```bash
cd /path/to/destiation/of/link
ln /path/to/dotfile
```
### I plan on making a bash script to add the pushed dotfiles back into their directories, if needed.
